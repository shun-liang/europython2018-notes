# Threads
CPU needs constantly switch context and can be deadlocks

# Asynchronous programming
- Event loop
 - Queue of events/tasks

## asyncio

### Coroutines
- Multiple entry points

### Iterable: anything implements __iter__

### Iterator: object representing a stream of data: anything implements __next__, __iter__

### Generator function: body of function that contains `yield`
`yield` to send value
`yield from` - chaining generators

### asyncio.coroutine

### types.coroutine

### async

### async def

### await and __await__

Distinct coroutine from generators
